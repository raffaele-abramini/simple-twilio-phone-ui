# Simple Twilio phone ui

A local server with a browser interface to receive calls.


## Setup

#### 1.
Clone project and install dependencies with `npm i`
#### 2.
Start a tunnel from the project folder by running `npm run tunnel`
#### 3.
Create a Twml app from [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/twiml/apps).  
Under the **voice** tab, add your ngrok tunnel address followed by `/redirectToClient`

![Set voice endpoint](https://github.com/raffaele-abramini/simple-twilio-phone-ui/blob/master/docs/images/twml-app.png "Set TWML app")
 
 Once done and saved, copy this newly created application SID.
 
#### 4.
Buy or go to an existing Twilio phone number from your [console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming). Under Voice/Fax, set:
- **Accept incoming** to `voice call`
- **Configure with** to `TwML App`
- **Twiml app** to your newly created app.

And save!

#### 5.
In the repository, clone `secret.dummy.json` as a `secret.json` file and fill it with your credentials.
```javascript
{
  "accountSid": "", // your account sid (found at https://www.twilio.com/console)
  "authToken": "", // your auth token (found at https://www.twilio.com/console)
  "appSid":"", // your new Twml app SID
  "phoneNumber": "" // your new phone number
}
```


#### 6.

Finally, just run `npm start`. You can navigate to http://localhost:1234/ to see your UI.


#### NOTE!

If you don't have a premium account of ngrok, you'll have to update your TWML app endpoint every time you run `npm run tunnel`.


## API

Once up and running you interact with phone calls either via the UI or using some methods in your browser console.
Here's the list of those methods.

### Accept a call
`connection.accept()`
  
### Reject a call
`connection.reject()`

### Mute a call
`connection.mute()`  

### Unmute a call
`connection.mute(false)`  

### Send some digits
`connection.sendDigits("12")`

### Hangup
`connection.disconnect(")`  

### Send an automated answer
`setAnswer("fakeAnswer")`

### Send a "busy" signal
`setAnswer("busy")`

### Hold the call (disconnect and play a music to caller)
`setAnswer("enqueue")`
